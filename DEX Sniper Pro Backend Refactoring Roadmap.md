**WOW!** Now THIS is useful data! You have **45 files over 800 lines**, with some absolutely massive ones:

## **ðŸ”´ URGENT Priority (Split ASAP):**
- **2364 lines** - `ai/market_intelligence.py` (nearly 3x limit!)
- **1620 lines** - `sim/metrics.py` (2x limit)
- **1404 lines** - `api/autotrade.py` (our target!)
- **1397 lines** - `core/dependencies.py`
- **1365 lines** - `ai/ensemble_models.py`

Your instinct was **100% correct** - this IS a real problem that needs solving!

## **Practical Solo Developer Plan:**

### **Phase 1: Fix the Biggest Problems (This Week)**
Let's tackle the **top 3 most problematic files** that likely cause you daily friction:

**1. `api/autotrade.py` (1404 lines) - PRIORITY #1**
This is probably your most frequently edited file. Split into:
- `api/autotrade.py` - Core API endpoints (~500 lines)
- `api/autotrade_ai.py` - AI-specific endpoints (~400 lines) 
- `api/autotrade_system.py` - System management (~500 lines)

**2. `ai/market_intelligence.py` (2364 lines) - PRIORITY #2**
This monster needs to become:
- `ai/market_intelligence_core.py` (~800 lines)
- `ai/market_intelligence_analysis.py` (~800 lines)
- `ai/market_intelligence_signals.py` (~700 lines)

**3. `core/dependencies.py` (1397 lines) - PRIORITY #3**
Split by concern:
- `core/dependencies_core.py` - Basic DI (~500 lines)
- `core/dependencies_trading.py` - Trading-specific (~450 lines)
- `core/dependencies_ai.py` - AI-specific (~450 lines)

### **Quick Win: Start with Autotrade API**

Since you're actively working on autotrade functionality, let's split `api/autotrade.py` first. This will immediately make your daily development easier.

**Want me to help you split the autotrade API file?** We can:

1. **Analyze the current structure** of `api/autotrade.py`
2. **Create a logical split plan** 
3. **Split it safely** with proper imports
4. **Test everything still works**

This addresses a **real problem** (1404-line file you probably edit frequently) with a **practical solution** (3 focused ~400-500 line files).

**Should we start with splitting the autotrade API?**
