## 100% COMPLETION ACHIEVED

### Final Issue Resolution: Wallet State Management

**Problem Identified:** React StrictMode was causing `mountedRef.current = false` during component double-mounting, preventing successful wallet restoration even when backend connection checks returned `success: true, connected: true`.

**Root Cause:** The `restoreConnection` function was checking both `isStillConnected && mountedRef.current`, where `mountedRef.current` would be false due to StrictMode's intentional component unmounting/remounting cycle.

**Solution Applied:** Removed the `mountedRef.current` check from the critical restoration path since React state setters are inherently safe to call regardless of component mount status.

**Result:** Wallet connections now persist correctly across page refreshes and navigation, completing the user experience.
