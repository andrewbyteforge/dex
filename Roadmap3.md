## Remaining Work: Ledger API Functionality (0.5% Outstanding)

The database schema issues that were blocking ledger operations have been resolved. The application now has a properly structured database with working relationships between User and LedgerEntry models.

### Priority 1: Ledger API Endpoint Testing (0.5% Outstanding)

**Problem Resolved:** Database AttributeError exceptions in ledger operations
**Current Status:** Database models fixed, foreign key relationships working
**Remaining:** Test that ledger endpoints now return proper data instead of errors

- ✅ Added `created_at` field that repository queries expected
- ✅ Fixed FastAPI status imports in `backend/app/api/ledger.py`
- ✅ Added `ledger_entries` relationship to User model
- ✅ Resolved all AttributeError exceptions in database queries

**Next Testing Required:**
1. **Verify Ledger Endpoints** - Confirm `/api/v1/ledger/*` endpoints return data instead of 500 errors
2. **Test Portfolio Data Flow** - Ensure frontend receives real portfolio data from fixed database
3. **Validate User Association** - Confirm ledger entries properly link to user accounts
4. **Frontend Integration Test** - Replace demo data with real portfolio tracking
