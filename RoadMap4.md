# RoadMap4: Autotrade Implementation - Updated Status

## Current Project State:
- Core autotrade engine structure (backend/app/autotrade/engine.py)
- API endpoints framework (backend/app/api/autotrade.py) 
- Strategy framework (backend/app/strategy/strategies.py)
- Risk management system
- Trading executor foundation

---

## Phase 1: Core Engine Integration - COMPLETED âœ…

**Goal**: Connect the autotrade engine to real trading systems

**Completed Work:**
- Created autotrade integration layer (`backend/app/autotrade/integration.py`)
  - Real service dependency injection for AutotradeEngine
  - Discovery system integration with opportunity detection
  - Real trade execution replacing mock implementation
  - Event-driven opportunity creation from new pair/trending token discovery
- Updated API endpoints (`backend/app/api/autotrade.py`)
  - Replaced mock state with real AutotradeEngine integration
  - Added proper authentication and user context
  - Real opportunity queue management
  - Live engine status and metrics
- Added missing dependencies (`backend/app/core/dependencies.py`)
  - get_risk_manager() - Risk assessment service
  - get_safety_controls() - Circuit breakers and safety controls
  - get_performance_analytics() - Trade performance tracking
  - get_event_processor() - Discovery event processing
  - get_transaction_repository() - Database transaction handling
- **ðŸ”§ CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Resolved endpoint routing conflicts
  - Removed mock autotrade endpoints from `basic_endpoints.py` 
  - Cleaned up conflicting `/autotrade/*` routes that were blocking real implementation
  - Real autotrade API now accessible without routing conflicts

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Autotrade engine now connects to real trading systems with functional API endpoints

---

## Phase 2: Opportunity Detection Pipeline

**Goal**: Create the opportunity discovery and filtering system

**Planned Work:**
- New pair detection integration
- Trending token re-entry detection  
- Risk scoring and filtering
- Queue management with conflict resolution

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion âœ…

**Status**: Ready to begin - Phase 1 foundation complete

---

## Phase 3: Execution & Safety Controls

**Goal**: Safe automated trade execution

**Planned Work:**
- Trade execution with safety controls
- Circuit breakers and kill switches
- Position sizing and risk limits
- Canary testing integration

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion

---

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Control Interface

**Goal**: Real-time monitoring and manual controls

**Planned Work:**
- Real-time WebSocket feeds
- Manual override capabilities
- Performance metrics and alerts
- Configuration management UI

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Optimization

**Goal**: Advanced autotrade capabilities

**Planned Work:**
- Multi-strategy coordination
- AI-assisted parameter tuning
- Advanced opportunity scoring
- Performance optimization

**Dependencies**: Phase 4 completion

---

## Key Architectural Changes Made:

1. **Real Service Integration**: Replaced mock implementations with actual service connections
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Discovery events now create trading opportunities automatically  
3. **Proper Dependency Injection**: All services properly wired through FastAPI dependencies
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Production-ready logging and error management
5. **Type Safety**: Fixed all parameter mismatches and type issues
6. **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved API routing conflicts by cleaning up mock endpoints

## Recent Completion:

**Bug Fix - Endpoint Routing Conflicts (Phase 1.1)**: âœ… RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Mock autotrade endpoints in `basic_endpoints.py` were conflicting with real autotrade implementation
- **Root Cause**: FastAPI was routing `/autotrade/*` requests to mock endpoints instead of real ones
- **Solution**: Removed all mock autotrade code from `basic_endpoints.py`:
  - Deleted `AutotradeMode` enum and `AutotradeModeRequest` model
  - Removed mock `autotrade_state` and `activities_log` 
  - Cleaned up `broadcast_autotrade_update()` and `add_activity_log()` functions
  - Deleted conflicting autotrade endpoint functions
- **Result**: Real autotrade API endpoints now fully accessible and functional

The foundation is now solid and **fully functional** for building the remaining phases on real, working systems rather than placeholder code.
