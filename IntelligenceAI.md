## AI Integration Action Plan for DEX Sniper Pro

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Create working risk scoring system with basic intelligence

#### Step 1.1: Implement Basic Risk Scoring
**File**: `backend/app/strategy/risk_scoring.py`
- Create numerical risk scores (0-100) based on:
  - Liquidity depth (20% weight)
  - Holder distribution (15% weight)
  - Contract age (10% weight)
  - Trading volume patterns (15% weight)
  - Price volatility (20% weight)
  - Security scan results (20% weight)

#### Step 1.2: Create Market Intelligence Engine
**File**: `backend/app/ai/market_intelligence.py`
- Implement the missing file with basic heuristics:
  - Volume momentum indicators
  - Liquidity growth rate
  - Buy/sell pressure analysis
  - Simple pattern detection (pump indicators)

#### Step 1.3: Connect to Frontend
- Modify `AIIntelligenceDisplay.jsx` to show real metrics
- Display risk score, confidence level, and key indicators
- Add color coding (green/yellow/red) for quick assessment

### Phase 2: External Data Integration (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Enhance intelligence with external security data

#### Step 2.1: Integrate GoPlus Security API
- Contract security scanning
- Honeypot detection
- Owner privilege analysis
- Tax/fee extraction

#### Step 2.2: Add Token Metadata Service
- Holder count tracking
- Whale wallet detection
- Team wallet identification
- Liquidity lock verification

#### Step 2.3: Implement Anomaly Detection
**File**: `backend/app/ai/anomaly_detector.py`
- Sudden liquidity changes (Â±50% in 5 minutes)
- Unusual trading patterns (coordinated buys)
- Gas war detection
- Mempool analysis for sandwich attacks

### Phase 3: Auto-Tuning Implementation (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Make auto-tuning functional with guardrails

#### Step 3.1: Parameter Optimization Logic
**File**: `backend/app/ai/tuner.py`
- Implement actual optimization using historical data:
  - Slippage optimization based on volatility
  - Gas price optimization based on network congestion
  - Position sizing based on liquidity and risk score

#### Step 3.2: Backtesting Framework
- Create simulator for testing parameter sets
- Track win rate, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- Store results in decision journal

#### Step 3.3: Guardrail System
- Hard limits on all parameters
- User approval required for changes beyond thresholds
- Emergency stop if losses exceed limits

### Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration (Week 4-6)
**Goal**: Add predictive capabilities

#### Step 4.1: Data Collection Pipeline
- Store all trading decisions and outcomes
- Track market conditions at decision time
- Record success/failure patterns

#### Step 4.2: Pattern Recognition Model
- Use scikit-learn for initial models:
  - Random Forest for rug pull prediction
  - Logistic regression for trade success probability
  - Time series analysis for price movement prediction

#### Step 4.3: Model Serving
- Create model inference endpoints
- Cache predictions for performance
- Implement model versioning and rollback

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 6-8)
**Goal**: Differentiate with unique AI capabilities

#### Step 5.1: Whale Wallet Tracking
- Monitor known whale wallets
- Alert on whale entries/exits
- Correlation analysis with price movements

#### Step 5.2: Social Sentiment Analysis (Optional)
- Telegram/Discord monitoring for token mentions
- Sentiment scoring
- Hype cycle detection

#### Step 5.3: MEV Protection
- Sandwich attack detection
- Private mempool submission recommendations
- Optimal block timing suggestions

## Minimum Viable AI (for immediate launch):

```python
# backend/app/ai/quick_intelligence.py
async def get_quick_intelligence(token_address: str, chain: str) -> dict:
    """Minimum viable intelligence for launch."""
    
    # Get basic metrics
    liquidity = await get_liquidity(token_address, chain)
    holders = await get_holder_count(token_address, chain)
    age = await get_contract_age(token_address, chain)
    volume_24h = await get_24h_volume(token_address, chain)
    
    # Calculate simple risk score
    risk_score = 50  # Start neutral
    
    if liquidity < 10000:
        risk_score += 20  # Higher risk
    elif liquidity > 100000:
        risk_score -= 10  # Lower risk
        
    if holders < 50:
        risk_score += 15
    elif holders > 500:
        risk_score -= 10
        
    if age < 1:  # Less than 1 day
        risk_score += 25
    elif age > 7:
        risk_score -= 5
    
    # Convert to intelligence score (inverse of risk)
    intelligence_score = max(0, min(100, 100 - risk_score))
    
    return {
        "intelligence_score": intelligence_score,
        "risk_level": "high" if risk_score > 70 else "medium" if risk_score > 40 else "low",
        "confidence": 0.6,  # Fixed confidence for basic analysis
        "factors": {
            "liquidity_usd": liquidity,
            "holder_count": holders,
            "contract_age_days": age,
            "volume_24h": volume_24h
        },
        "recommendation": "trade" if intelligence_score > 60 else "monitor" if intelligence_score > 40 else "avoid"
    }
```

This gives you a working AI system quickly while building toward the full implementation.
